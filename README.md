How it started: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ogK0MIzqk

To Do
- calculate legal moves
- Scale the images so don't have to do it in Form1.cs
- only allow clicking on pieces to start a move and only those for who's turn it is

Done
- upgrade VS
- images for pieces
-	See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess#Computer_chess
-   Needed the PNG instead of the SVG
- See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess#Computer_chess
- Build board (how about 64 buttons?)
- Scale image on PictureBox
-   built-in size is 127x127. Let's start with 64x64
- Translate FEN
- Move (by clicking from/to)

Other ideas
- Install copilot
